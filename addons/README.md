# About this directory

The `addons` directory contains the code for addons that are useful for the ARF.

The thing that distinguishes this directory from `scripts` is that ideally things here could theoretically be disabled without 
throwing a python error in the users face, even if *functionally* it renders the application useless. These addons could be taken
and used independently if the user chooses to do so for whatever reason.
