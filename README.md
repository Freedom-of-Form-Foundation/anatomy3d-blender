This project is a tool to design realistic anatomy in Blender using biomechanical principles. The repository is currently work-in-progress.

## Repository Structure

 - `modules` - contains custom Python modules common to the project but useful elsewhere too.
 - `assets` - contains standard, barebones object types that contain the appropriate initial settings and geometry nodes.
 - `presets` - directory contains example models and objects for humanoid anatomy that can be inserted by the user.
 - `scripts` - contains Python scripts specifically used for this project.
